# DDoS Detection Using Random Forest

This project focuses on detecting **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attacks in network traffic using the **Random Forest** machine learning model. It uses the **UNSW-NB15** dataset for training and testing the model and evaluates the effectiveness of the model in detecting DDoS attacks with high accuracy.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a robust **DDoS detection system** that can accurately classify network traffic as **normal** or **DDoS attack**. Using the **Random Forest** model, the system is trained on the **UNSW-NB15** dataset, which contains both benign and malicious traffic data. The model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrix**.

## Dataset
The project uses the **UNSW-NB15** dataset, which is specifically designed for network intrusion detection tasks. The dataset contains labeled instances of both **normal** network traffic and multiple types of **DDoS attacks**.

## Requirements
Before running the code, make sure to install the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `imblearn`

You can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ddos-detection-random-forest.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy
cd ddos-detection-random-forest
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preprocessing:

The script first loads the training and testing datasets and handles any missing or infinite values.

It then applies feature engineering and scaling to prepare the data for training.

Model Training:

The Random Forest model is initialized and trained on the training data.

Model Evaluation:

After training, the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.

To run the project, use the following command:

bash
Copy
python train_and_evaluate_model.py
Model Evaluation
The evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance:

Accuracy: Overall percentage of correctly classified instances.

Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions.

Recall: Proportion of true positive predictions to the actual positive instances.

F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Confusion Matrix: Visualization of the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative instances.

[[246   4]  # Normal (True Positive, False Negative)
 [  3 247]] # DDoS (False Positive, True Positive)
Future Enhancements
Hyperparameter Tuning: Improve the model by fine-tuning the hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

Handling Class Imbalance: Experiment with different techniques for balancing the dataset, such as SMOTE or class weighting.

Advanced Feature Engineering: Add more complex features based on network traffic patterns or time-series analysis.

Real-Time Detection: Integrate the model into a real-time detection system using cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud.

Model Explainability: Use SHAP or LIME to make the model's decisions interpretable and transparent.

Deployment: Deploy the model to monitor network traffic in real-time and integrate with firewalls and SIEM systems.
